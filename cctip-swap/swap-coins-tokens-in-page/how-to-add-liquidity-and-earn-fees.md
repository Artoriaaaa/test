# How to add liquidity and earn fees?

**83%** of each transaction fee will be added to the liquidity pool as incentives for liquidity providers when they remove liquidity.

**Currently we only support token pairs with USDT/ETH/DOGE/TRX.**

Take "ETH/USDT" as an example. Click "**Pool**", select "**ETH**" and "**USDT**" for tokens, enter the amount you want to add, and click "**Supply**". After confirming the information, click "**Confirm**".
