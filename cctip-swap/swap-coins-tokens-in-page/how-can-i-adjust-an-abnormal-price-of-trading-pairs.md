# How can I adjust an abnormal price of trading pairs?

If you find the price abnormal, you can adjust it by swapping some tokens before adding liquidity. The steps are as follows:‌

On the Add Liquidity page, select the corresponding trading pair, click "**Unhappy with the price? Click here to adjust it**", enter a desired price, and click "**Next**". After the swap, the price will be adjusted successfully.​

_Note: The adjusted price cannot be too close to the current price; otherwise the adjustment will fail._
