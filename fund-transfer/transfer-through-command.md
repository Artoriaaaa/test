# Transfer through command

### What is fund transfer through command？

CCTip currently supports free and fast transfer of funds between Twitter, Telegram, Reddit, Discord. You only need to bind the same email address to supported platforms, and PM CCTip with transfer commands.

### What are the benefits of fund transfer?

With funds transfer, you can:

Deposit coins on one platform and transfer them to other platforms for airdrops. For example, you can deposit 1 BTC in Twitter, transfer 0.3 BTC to your Telegram account, and airdrop it in the Telegram group.

Pay the transaction fee only once for withdrawal after transferring funds to the same platform. For example, you have 0.3 ETH in Telegram, 0.7 ETH in Twitter, and 1 ETH in Discord. You can transfer 0.3 ETH in Telegram and 0.7 ETH in Twitter to Discord's account and then transfer all the 2 ETH in Discord 2 to your wallet. In this case, you need to pay the transaction fee for the withdrawal only.

### How to transfer funds?

#### 1. Before transfer, you need to bind the same email address to each platform. PM CCip on each platform and send the command to bind email. The commands for binding the email address are as follows:
