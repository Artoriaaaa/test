Confirm the transfer information, and after security verification, the transfer is done.



### Why can't I find the **recipient**?

The possible reasons are as below. Please check one by one:

* The recipient's username is incorrect; Fill in the correct username, and try again. 
* The recipient has not used CCTip; Ask the recipient to use CCTip, and try again. 
* The recipient has not used CCTip after modifying the username; Ask the recipient to use CCTip again, and try again.
