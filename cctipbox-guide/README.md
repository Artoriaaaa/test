Users can receive daily airdrops for free in [CCTip Box](https://my.cctip.io/download?utm_source=mycctip&utm_medium=poolguide) and join the draw to win huge bonuses.

Source of rewards: Every time a user receives a CCTip airdrop for free, CCTip will allocate 8% of the airdrop to the pool. Users receive 1 free airdrop in [CCTip Box](https://my.cctip.io/download?utm_source=mycctip&utm_medium=poolguide) every day, and after participating in the daily and weekly draws, they will have the opportunity to share huge rewards.
