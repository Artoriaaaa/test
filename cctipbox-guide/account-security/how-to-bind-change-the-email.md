# How to bind/change the email?

For asset safety, please bind your email. In the double verification and other operation related to resetting the payment password, you need to enter the email verification code. To ensure asset security, the email can be changed in [my.cctip](https://my.cctip.io/) and [CCTip Box App](https://my.cctip.io/download) only.  
Bind or change the email in "**Account Security**" - "**Email**".

The steps are as follows:

_Notes:  
After the email is changed,   
1. the current email will be **unbound** with accounts on **CCTip all platforms**;   
2. **the double verification** of the unbound email account will **be turned off.**_
