# How to change the daily limit of CCTip Bot?

The daily limit of CCTip Bot is applicable to transfer \(except withdrawals\) channels that directly talk to CCTip Bot on platforms such as Twitter/Telegram/Discord/Reddit, and does not include the transfer amount in the CCTip Box. The default value is $1,000. For asset safety, the daily limit of CCTip Bot can only be changed in [my.cctip](https://my.cctip.io/) and [CCTip Box App](https://my.cctip.io/download) only.

All assets-related operations on Twitter/Telegram/Discord/Reddit, including withdrawal, airdrops, rewards, draws, rains, issuing newcomer rewards, advertising, and conversion. 

The steps are as follows:  
In "**Account Security**" - "**CCTip Bot Daily Limit**", click Change, enter the value, and verify the payment password.
