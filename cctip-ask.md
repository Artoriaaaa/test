# CCTip Ask

CCTip Ask is a Q&A application developed by CCTip based on Twitter. You can pay others digital currencies before asking them questions, and the person being asked will gain profit after answering the questions. If you are interested in questions asked by others, with only a small amount of digital currency you can see the answer. Through CCTip Ask, everyone has access to knowledge and benefits.

## How to ask a question?

Just tweet with "your question + question command".

Question command:

> @cctip question TokenAmount TokenSymbol @Person\_questioned

For example, pay 1 ETH to ask @Lucy "Do you think there is anything to be improved in CCTip?" Tweet as below:

Do you think there is anything to be improved in CCTip?  
**@cctip\_io question 1 ETH @Lucy**

_Note:   
1. The question needs to be in front of the question command.  
2. Please make sure that you have sufficient balance before asking questions; otherwise the question will not be valid.  
3. The reward shall not be less than 10,000 times the minimum accuracy of the token. For example, questions with USDT as rewards should be worth not less than 0.01 USDT._

After you ask the question, CCTip will retweet your tweet, generate a link to the question, and notify @Lucy of answering it. @Lucy needs to answer the question within 72 hours; otherwise the question will be expired and the cryptocurrency will be returned to the questioner's account.
