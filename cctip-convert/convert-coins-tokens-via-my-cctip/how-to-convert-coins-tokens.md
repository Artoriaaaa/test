# How to convert coins/tokens?

If you want to convert your coins/tokens to other coins/tokens, you can go to "[**Market**](https://my.cctip.io/token/exchange)", find the ad you want, and convert coins/tokens. If you donâ€™t find the ad you like, you can also post an ad and set preferred conversion rate, and wait for others to convert coins/tokens with you.

1. Click "[**Market**](https://my.cctip.io/token/exchange)", select "**ETH**" and "**DOGE**"
