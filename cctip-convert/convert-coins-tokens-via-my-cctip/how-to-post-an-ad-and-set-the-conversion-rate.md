# How to post an ad and set the conversion rate?

If you donâ€™t find the ad you like, you can also post an ad and set preferred conversion rate, and wait for others to convert coins/tokens with you.

Take "**Post an ad: Convert 0.000004 ETH to DOGE**" as an example. Complete the conversion in the following 4 steps:

1. Click **"Post an ad"** on "**My Ad**"

After posting an ad, you can wait for others to convert coins/tokens with you. You can view your ad information in **"My ads"** and transaction record in **"Record"**. Every transaction will be in the Record.

_Notes:  
1. Free for posting ads, 1% for each transaction.  
2. The ad is valid for 7 days after it is posted, and will automatically expire if it is not completed within 7 days;  
3. During the ad validity, you can enter_  **"My ads"** _to manually remove the valid ad._
