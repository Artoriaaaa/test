# How to post an ad and set the conversion rate?

If you donâ€™t find the ad you like, you can also post an ad and set preferred conversion rate, and wait for others to convert coins/tokens with you.

### 1. PM cctip\_bot to post an ad

Take "**Post an ad: Convert 1 ETH to 100,000 DOGE**" as an example. PM cctip\_bot with "**post 100000 DOGE for 1 ETH**". After the ad is posted, it will be valid for 7 days. You can share the ad to the group to make it known by more, and wait for others to convert coins/tokens with you.

### 2. Post an ad in the group

If you post an ad in a group, the group members can directly see it and may convert coins/tokens with you. You can share the ad to the group to make it known by more, and wait for others to convert coins/tokens with you.

Take "**Post an ad: Convert 1 ETH to 100,000 DOGE**" as an example. You should send "**cc post 100000 DOGE for 1 ETH**" in the group. After the ad is posted, it will be valid for 7 days. You can share the ad to the group to make it known by more, and wait for others to convert coins/tokens with you.
