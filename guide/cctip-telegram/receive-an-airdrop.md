# Receive an airdrop

### Receive an ordinary airdrop

Ordinary airdrops do not carry with a keyword. For example: "**cc airdrop 1 BTC 100**" and "**cc draw 1 BTC 100**".

You only need to send "**grab**" in the group to get the coins.

### Receive an airdrop with a keyword

Take airdrops with a keyword such as "**cc airdrop 1 BTC 100 \#BTC\_to\_da\_moon**" and "**cc draw 1 BTC 100 \#BTC\_to\_da\_moon**" as examples.

You need to send "**\#BTC\_to\_da\_moon**" to get the coins.
