# Shortcut Commands

The commands are too complicated? Easy to make mistakes? Don't worry. Here are some shortcut commands of CCTip. These allow you to enter fewer tests or more personalized texts to send airdrops or tips. Shortcut commands are divided into two groups: the free ones and the exclusive ones. You can use the free shortcut commands directly in groups, and the exclusive ones will take effect only after purchase.

### 1. Free shortcut commands

The following shortcut commands are free to use:

**cc drawbch**: This command is equivalent to the command "**cc draw 0.001 BCH 10**". With it, the next 10 people who send messages beginning with "**grab**" will immediately get a random share from the 0.001 BCH.

**cc draweth**: This command is equivalent to the command "**cc draw 0.001 ETH 10**". With it, the next 10 people who send messages beginning with "**grab**" will immediately get a random share from the 0.001 ETH.

**cc drawbtc**: This command is equivalent to the command "**cc draw 0.00005 BTC 10**". With it, the next 10 people who send messages beginning with "**grab**" will immediately get a random share from the 0.00005 BTC.

**cc drawusdt**: This command is equivalent to the command "**cc draw 0.2 USDT 10**". With it, the next 10 people who send messages beginning with "**grab**" will immediately get a random share from the 0.2 USDT.

**cc drawspice**: This command is equivalent to the command "**cc draw 100 SPICE 10**". With it, the next 10 people who send messages beginning with "**grab**" will immediately get a random share from the 100 SPICE.

### 2. Buy exclusive shortcut commands

Exclusive commands cost 1.99 USDT for 30 days, with command validity ranging from 30 days to 180 days. After successful purchase, the USDT from the account will be deducted.

**How to buy:**

For example, to buy the 30-day shortcut command of "**cc GetRichTegother**" and set the airdrop as one with the total amount of 1.2 ETH and the quantity of receivers being 10, follow the steps below:

PM cctipbot with the command "**buyWords GetRichTegother = 30 airdrop 1.2 ETH 10**". cctip\_bot will automatically detect your account balance, and the balance, if it is sufficient, will be automatically deducted accordingly. Then you will be informed of the purchase success.

**How to use:**

Within 30 days after purchase, you can use the command directly in any groups with cctip\_bot.

To send ordinary airdrops: Send the command "**cc GetRichTegother**", and the next 10 people who send messages beginning with "**grab**" will immediately grab a random share from the 1.2 ETH.

To send an airdrop with a keyword: For example, send the command "**cc GetRichTegother \#123**", and the next 10 people who send "**\#123**" in the message will immediately get a random share from the 1.2 ETH.
