## Create an airdrop

Deposit enough coins in your account.

2. Add @cctip\_bot into the group  
Add @cctip\_bot to the group and enter the command to create an airdrop.

Note: The number of airdrop receivers must not be less than 2.

### 1. Create an airdrop

Take "**cc airdrop 1 BTC 100**" as an example.  You can send this command in a group to create an airdrop in equal amount.

The airdrop follows the rule as below: Send a total of 1 BTC. The first 100 users who send "**grab**" will equally share the 1 BTC.

Command format:

> cc airdrop TokenAmount TokenSymbol NumberOfPeople

### 2. Create an airdrop with a keyword

If you want everyone to receive an equal amount and only those who send a message containing a certain keyword can receive the airdrop, you can create an airdrop in equal amount with a keyword.

Take "**cc airdrop 1 BTC 100 \#BTC\_to\_da\_moon**" as an example. You can send this command in a group to create an airdrop in equal amount with a keyword.

The airdrop follows the rule as below: The first 100 users who send "**\#BTC\_to\_da\_moon**" will equally receive a share of 1 BTC.

Command format:

> cc airdrop TokenAmount TokenSymbol NumberOfPeople \#keywords

### 3. Create an airdrop in random amount

If you want everyone to receive a random amount, you can create an airdrop in random amount.

Take "**cc draw 1 BTC 100**" as an example. You can send this command in a group to create an airdrop in random amount.

The airdrop follows the rule as below: The first 100 users who send "**grab**" will randomly receive a share of 1 BTC.

Command format:

> cc draw TokenAmount TokenSymbol NumberOfPeople

### 4. Create an airdrop in random amount with a keyword

If you want everyone to receive a random amount and only those who send a message containing a certain keyword can receive the airdrop, you can create an airdrop in random amount with a keyword.

The airdrop follows the rule as below: The first 100 users who send "**\#BTC\_to\_da\_moon**" will randomly receive a share of 1 BTC.

Command format:

> cc draw TokenAmount TokenSymbol NumberOfPeople \#keywords

### 5. Create a giveaway

If you want to send an airdrop in the group without the repetitious messages flooding the screen, you can use the giveaway command.

Take "**cc giveaway 1 BTC 100**" as an example. You can send this command in a group to create an airdrop in random amount. 

The airdrop follows the rule as below: The first 100 users clicking the button “Grab a share from 1 BTC “ will get a random amount from the airdrop.

## Receive an airdrop

#### Receive an ordinary airdrop

Ordinary airdrops do not carry with a keyword. For example: "**cc airdrop 1 BTC 100**" and "**cc draw 1 BTC 100**".

You only need to send "**grab**" in the group to get the coins.

#### Receive an airdrop with a keyword

Take airdrops with a keyword such as "**cc airdrop 1 BTC 100 \#BTC\_to\_da\_moon**" and "**cc draw 1 BTC 100 \#BTC\_to\_da\_moon**" as examples.

You need to send "**\#BTC\_to\_da\_moon**" to get the coins.

## Rain

If you want to activate more users and get them involved in discussion by randomly sending airdrops in the group, you can use the rain command.

Take “**cc rain 1 BTC 100**” as an example. Send this command in the group, and the rain will get started.

The rule of the rain is as below: 100 lucky users will be randomly selected in the group, each receiving 0.01 BTC.

Command format:

> cc rain TokenAmount TokenSymbol NumberOfPeople

## Tip

Deposit enough coins for the airdrop in your account.

2. Add cctip\_bot into the group  
Add cctip\_bot to the group and enter a tipping command.

## Shortcut Commands

The commands are too complicated? Easy to make mistakes? Don't worry. Here are some shortcut commands of CCTip. These allow you to enter fewer tests or more personalized texts to send airdrops or tips. Shortcut commands are divided into two groups: the free ones and the exclusive ones. You can use the free shortcut commands directly in groups, and the exclusive ones will take effect only after purchase.

### 1. Free shortcut commands

The following shortcut commands are free to use:

**cc drawbch**: This command is equivalent to the command "**cc draw 0.001 BCH 10**". With it, the next 10 people who send messages beginning with "**grab**" will immediately get a random share from the 0.001 BCH.

**cc draweth**: This command is equivalent to the command "**cc draw 0.001 ETH 10**". With it, the next 10 people who send messages beginning with "**grab**" will immediately get a random share from the 0.001 ETH.

**cc drawbtc**: This command is equivalent to the command "**cc draw 0.00005 BTC 10**". With it, the next 10 people who send messages beginning with "**grab**" will immediately get a random share from the 0.00005 BTC.

**cc drawusdt**: This command is equivalent to the command "**cc draw 0.2 USDT 10**". With it, the next 10 people who send messages beginning with "**grab**" will immediately get a random share from the 0.2 USDT.

**cc drawspice**: This command is equivalent to the command "**cc draw 100 SPICE 10**". With it, the next 10 people who send messages beginning with "**grab**" will immediately get a random share from the 100 SPICE.

### 2. Buy exclusive shortcut commands

Exclusive commands cost 1.99 USDT for 30 days, with command validity ranging from 30 days to 180 days. After successful purchase, the USDT from the account will be deducted.

**How to buy:**

For example, to buy the 30-day shortcut command of "**cc GetRichTegother**" and set the airdrop as one with the total amount of 1.2 ETH and the quantity of receivers being 10, follow the steps below:

PM cctipbot with the command "**buyWords GetRichTegother = 30 airdrop 1.2 ETH 10**". cctip\_bot will automatically detect your account balance, and the balance, if it is sufficient, will be automatically deducted accordingly. Then you will be informed of the purchase success.

**How to use:**

Within 30 days after purchase, you can use the command directly in any groups with cctip\_bot.

To send ordinary airdrops: Send the command "**cc GetRichTegother**", and the next 10 people who send messages beginning with "**grab**" will immediately grab a random share from the 1.2 ETH.

To send an airdrop with a keyword: For example, send the command "**cc GetRichTegother \#123**", and the next 10 people who send "**\#123**" in the message will immediately get a random share from the 1.2 ETH.

Command format:

> buyWords WORDS = NumberOfDays DetailOfWords

### 🔥 Upgrade to DAO Group

The DAO Group refers to a group of users who meet certain conditions. You can easily set a threshold to allow in only those who hold at least a certain amount of certain tokens on the chain or in a CCTip account.

Setting method:   
Switch on **"Upgrade to DAO Group"**, select the chain, enter the token contract address, and enter the minimum number of holdings. If you want to set the coin of the chain, just click the pull-down menu to select one.

**Rule of DAO group: CCTip will verify the qualification when users join or speak, and will remove those disqualified.**

Take the setting of “**group members must hold ≥ 0.0001 USDT on the Ethereum**” as an example. The setting method is as follows:  
Select ETH, enter the USDT contract address, and enter 0.0001. __Remember to add "**Ban User"** permission for **@cctip\_bot,** otherwise the bot can not remove those disqualified.

#### Set newcomer rewards

By setting newcomer rewards, you can encourage members to invite new users to the group. In a group with newcomer rewards, both the inviter and the newcomer will be rewarded. 

Setting method:  
Activate the option "Newcomer rewards", select the reward token, enter the amount of rewards received by the inviter and by the newcomer. To avoid cheating, you can set a keyword to prevent fake accounts from receiving the newcomer rewards.

For example, if the inviter rewards are 0.4 BCH and the newcomer rewards 0.6 BCH and the newcomer needs to reply with the keyword "\#Hi, everybody" before getting rewards, you need to set as below:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28316%29.png)

If the "Keyword for receipt" field is empty, the newcomer can get the rewards as soon as they join the group.

_Note: Only by clicking "···" - "Add member"  in the upper right corner of the group and inviting newcomers can you receive the inviter rewards._
