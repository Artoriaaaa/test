# Tip

If you want to tip users to share more valuable information, use the tipping command.

It only takes 2 steps to tip on Discord:

1. [Deposit](https://doc.cctip.io/guide/cctip-discord/deposit)  
Deposit enough coins in your account.

2. Tip  
Add @CCTip Bot\#0897 into the server and send tip command.

#### Tip one or more persons

Take "**cc 0.01 ETH @lisa @David**" as an example. By sending this command in a server, you will tip.

The tipping follows the rule as below: After @CCTip Bot\#0897 is added into a channel, Peter and Lucy will each receive 0.01 ETH.

Command format:

> cc TokenAmount TokenSymbol @user1 @user2 @userN
