# How to identify a fake airdrop?

You can determine whether this airdrop is valid or not according to whether there is a reply from CCTip\_io below the original tweet.

Common fake airdrops:

The airdrop command in the original tweet is invalid. \(Causes behind an invalid command: 1. Insufficient balance; 2. Wrong command; 3. Tokens of the airdrop not supported in CCTipï¼›4. The number of airdrop receivers is less than 5\)

The airdrop command in the original tweet has ended. \(The airdrop has ended as all the coins have been claimed, so you can't receive coins even if you retweet\)

You can enter the URL of the tweet at [https://cctip.io/tracking](https://cctip.io/tracking). Click on Enquire, and, if you find no information, it means that it is a fake airdrop.
