# Why didn't I receive a reply from CCTip after creating an airdrop?

That is because of the incorrect airdrop command. There are several common mistakes: - Wrong airdrop command input

* Insufficient token balance for the airdrop   
* Tokens of the airdrop not supported in CCTip   
* Amount of airdropped tokens &lt;= 0   
* The No. of participants in the airdrop &gt;99999   
* In Twitter, you ticked "More - Privacy and safety - Protect your Tweets"

Please double check the command you use and try again.
