# My Twitter account has been suspended. How do I bind my original email to a new Twitter account?

Suppose you have two Twitter accounts \(**Twitter A** and **Twitter B**\), one **Telegram** account, and two email addresses \(**Email a** and **Email b**\).

If **Twitter A** is successfully bound to Email a **\(Twitter A ⇨ Email a\)** but has been officially suspended by Twitter , you cannot authorize **Twitter A** to log in to [my.cctip.io](https://my.cctip.io/). If you want to bind Twitter B to Email a **\(Twitter B ⇨ Email a\)**, please follow the steps below:

1. [Bind](https://doc.cctip.io/#how-to-transfer-funds) Email a with your Telegram account **\(Telegram ⇨ Email a\)**
2. Repeat the above steps for binding, and [bind](https://doc.cctip.io/#how-to-transfer-funds) your Telegram account to Email b **\(Telegram ⇨ Email b\)**
3. [Bind](https://doc.cctip.io/#how-to-transfer-funds) Twitter B to Email a **\(Twitter B ⇨ Email a\)**
