# Why am I not rewarded after I retweet?

Possible reasons are as follows:

* The airdrop command in the original tweet is invalid. \(Causes behind an invalid command: 1. Insufficient balance; 2. Wrong command; 3. Tokens of the airdrop not supported in CCTipï¼›4. The number of airdrop receivers is less than 5\)
* The activity has ended. For example, no vacancies for more participants.
* Your Twitter account is a new account. You can get rewards after retweeting only if your Twitter account has more than 20 followers and was registered more than 7 days ago.
* The number of times you receive airdrops within 24 hours has exceeded the daily limit \(20 times\).
* You can receive only one airdrop from one user within 24 hours.
