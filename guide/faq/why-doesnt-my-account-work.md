# Why doesn't my account work?

When the system suspects you of abusing CCTip and other illegal operations with your account, CCTip will restrict the normal use of the account. To resume, please email chenxi@blockabc.com and provide KYC information, including a photo of the ID card and a photo of you holding the ID card.

To ensure fairness, CCTip has zero tolerance for robot accounts and fake accounts. If you encounter a robot account that abuses the CCTip service, please report it to us.
