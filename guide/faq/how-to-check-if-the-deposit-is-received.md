# How to check if the deposit is received?

Log in to [my.cctip.io](https://my.cctip.io), enter "**Records-&gt;Deposit**" to view the deposit records.

Please note: Each transfer must be confirmed on chain before the coins are successfully deposited. The available balance will be the deposit amount. Only after the successful deposit can the coins/tokens be used for tipping. Check record on [my.cctip.io](https://my.cctip.io/).
