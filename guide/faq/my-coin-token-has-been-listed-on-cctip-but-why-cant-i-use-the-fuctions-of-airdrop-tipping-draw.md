## My coin/token has been listed on CCTip, but why can't I use the fuctions of airdrop, tipping, draw, transfer or newcomer rewards?/The tokens I hold cannot be used on CCTip because the project developer has not renewed the service. What should I do?

For coins/tokens that have been listed on CCTip, if they exceed the validity period and are not renewed in time, their functions, other than deposit and withdrawal, are not allowed on CCTip.

If you want to continue using the token, you can:  
1. Go to the CCTip official website, find the token details page, and renew the service;  
2. Contact the project developer to remind it of renewal

**How to check the current status of tokens?**

Click the coin/token in the[ Coin page](https://cctip.io/index#Tokens) on the official website to check its current status.
