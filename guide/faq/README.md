# FAQ

## Why can't I use CCTip? 

In order to protect the rights and interests of each user and provide a healthy community environment for everyone, CCTip will continue to strengthen the detection of and crackdown on CCTip abuse during its operation. Such monitoring will go around the clock. Accounts involved in the abuse of CCTip will be permanently blocked as a punishment!

In response to the recent abuse of CCTip, we have permanently banned these accounts and returned the received assets in the same way. We hope everyone could take warning. We also welcome all users to report to us the abuse of CCTip, if any, at any time.

Users who intend to repent and have not caused harm could explain to us \([Join the official Telegram channel ](https://t.me/cctip)and contact the admins\), and we will take a 7-day ban on the accounts as a warning.

## Why am I not rewarded after I retweet?

Possible reasons are as follows:

* The airdrop command in the original tweet is invalid. \(Causes behind an invalid command: 1. Insufficient balance; 2. Wrong command; 3. Tokens of the airdrop not supported in CCTip；4. The number of airdrop receivers is less than 5\)
* The activity has ended. For example, no vacancies for more participants.
* Your Twitter account is a new account. You can get rewards after retweeting only if your Twitter account has more than 20 followers and was registered more than 7 days ago.
* The number of times you receive airdrops within 24 hours has exceeded the daily limit \(20 times\).
* You can receive only one airdrop from one user within 24 hours.
