# What if my account is blocked by the platform \(Twitter, Telegram ...\)?What if my account is suspende

If your account \(e.g. Telegram account, Twitter account ...\) is blocked by the platform, please send an email to [@Sweeki](https://t.me/Sweeki) to prove your identity with the email bound to the blocked account. In the email, please indicate your blocked account, the platform of the blocked account, the blockage, and other information you think necessary.

If you have bound the same email on multiple platforms before the account is closed, we will transfer the assets in the blocked account to your account on other platforms for you.

Therefore, to prevent your account from being blocked by the platform and loss of assets, it is suggested that you bind your email in time. [Know about asset transfer and email binding](https://doc.cctip.io/#fund-transfer)
