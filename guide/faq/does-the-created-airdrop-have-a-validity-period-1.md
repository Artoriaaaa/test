# Does the created airdrop have a validity period?

An airdrop stays valid for one week from its creation to the end. Say A has initiated an airdrop, and if this airdrop has not been claimed within one week, the remaining cryptocurrencies unclaimed will be returned to A's CCTip account. No cryptocurries in an expired airdrop can be claimed.

**Airdrop validity on each platform:**

* Twitter：7 days
* Telegram ：24 hours
* WeChat ：24 hours

After the airdrop expires, the uncollected amount will be automatically refunded to your account.
