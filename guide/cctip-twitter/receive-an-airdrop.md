# Receive an airdrop

#### Receive an ordinary airdrop

Ordinary airdrops do not carry with a keyword. For example: "**@cctip\_bot airdrop 1 BTC 100**" and "**@cctip\_bot draw 1 BTC 100**".

You only need to retweet to get the coins.

#### Receive an airdrop with a keyword

Take airdrops with a key such as "**@cctip\_io airdrop 1 BTC 100 \#BTC\_to\_da\_moon**" and "**@cctip\_bot draw 1 BTC 100 \#BTC\_to\_da\_moon**" as examples.

You need to include the keyword "**\#BTC\_to\_da\_moon**" in your comment of retweet to get the coins.
